a client connects
    create the rethink db query
        with all initial true, so we don't have race conditions
    associate client with query


a query answers
    push to the client who's connected to the query

    * Problems SocketIO seems not to support to push to specific clients on
      Python (probably wrong)
    * rethinkdb change is blocking, we can't run many of these using not Threads

        ws =
        g = gevent.Greenlet.spawn(read_feed).get()


if a document has ended, it would be wise to close the websocket after
sending the data.
It would be cooler to hang up server side than client side!


a client disconnects
    destroy the query

a feed ends
    send that to the client (and hang up?)


The plan dies because: each test needs all files, otherwise we can't run family tests successfully :-(
Also, family fonts themselves have different rules than single fonts.

Tough, as a preparation for a post-refactoring client, this would still be a good start.
We can just send at the end of a fb run X-different messages to the rethinkdb client,
having all the infrastructure in place for more complex runs.
